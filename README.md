#Purpose

Today's Drink is an application that suggests a beverage for a location based on the current weather conditions. From the application you can search for a location by city name and the app will display current weather conditions and suggest an ingredient. Alternatively, who cares what the weather is- bypass weather search all together and select an ingredient from the options- the application will display a curated list of beverage recipes.

# Getting Started

Enter a city, then click Search.
